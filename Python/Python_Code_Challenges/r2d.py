###This is function that will convert the user inputs from radians into degrees and then return that value.

#This will be used in the radians to degrees formula
pie = 3.14

#Request user input and store it in an int variable
print("Enter Radians")
radians = int(input()) 

#Variable for pie
pie = 3.14

#This is the formula for 
degrees = radians * 180 / pie 

#Outputs the degree value
print(degrees)
